# CS-370---TreasureHuntGame-RL
- For this project I worked on developing the Q-Training Algorithm section for the agent to ultimately reached the treasure using Q-learning and Deep Q Networks for decision making actions. Additionally, debugging and tuning the parameters like learning and winning rates, and the balance between exploration and exploitation. The code provided included the basic game environment, such as the grid-based layout and some helper functions for movement and reward/penalty assigning.
- In relation to computer science, I applied  machine learning and pathfiniding techniques which are used in gaming, AI driven automation and robotics. Additionally, via research, development and testing, I was able to evaluate the outcome results and adjust parameters accordingly. Computer scientists design software, solve complex problems and design algorithms. The work done is applied on a variety of industries like AI-driven applications and cybersecurity.
- Regarding thethical responsabilities related to AI, one must make sure that data is being collected and soruces responsibly, as well as understanding that AI models need to be trained without unfair biases to provide full transparency on the implementation of AI and how those AI-driven decisions are made.
